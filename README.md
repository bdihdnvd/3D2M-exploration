## Quick Start
Compiling tests passed on ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 with ros installed. You can just execute the following commands one by one.
```
git clone https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/3D2M-planner.git
cd 3D2M-planner/planner
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -j1
source devel/setup.bash
sh exp1.sh
```
Then you can use the 3D goal tool to operate.

## 3D2M-planner
This is the related repository of paper \textbf{Towards Efficient Trajectory Generation for Ground Robots beyond_2D Environment}. The repository contains the planner ros workspace and a unity project for verification. The planner enables global planning of ground robots in complex, multi-layered structural environments and allows joint planning of additional vertical degrees of freedom.

## Standard Compilation

**Requirements:** ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 with ros-desktop-full installation.

**Step 1.** 

**Step 2.** Clone the code from github.
```
git clone https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/3D2M-planner.git
```
**Step 3.** Compile.
```
cd 3D2M-planner/planner
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -j1
```
If you don't add "-j1", it may report an error while compiling, just compile it again.

**Step 4.** Run.

There are four quick start scriptsÔºö**exp1.sh** , **exp2.sh**, **exp1_unity.sh**, **exp2_unity.sh**

In **exp1.sh**, the robot is a four-wheel differential car. 

If you are using **unity** to simulate, please run **exp1_unity.sh**.

In **exp2.sh**, the robot is a differential car with a one-degree-of-freedom arm. 

Similarly, run **exp2_unity.sh** instead when using **unity**.

For example,
```
source devel/setup.bash
sh exp1.sh
```
